### What are we doing? (And why?)
There is no one central catalog (a database of library holdings) for searching and finding zines.  In the US, [Worldcat.org](worldcat.org) provides access to a union catalog, but it is mostly for books, journals, and audio visual materials. Zine and zine collections are not consistently cataloged in WorldCat.	

[The Zine Union Catalog](http://zinecat.org/) (ZUC) fills a gap by providing a searchable platform to discover zines and zine collections.	

### Who are we?
We are a group of librarians, zinesters, archivists, zine collectors, zine enthusiasts, and more.  :smile_cat: **All are welcome!!** :smile_cat: 

For the last two years, [Jenna Freedman](http://lowereastsidelibrarian.info/) & Lauren Kehoe have been working on the development of ZineCat through work in their [MA in Digital Humanities program at the CUNY Graduate Center](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Masters-Programs/Digital-Humanities).

### What do we need?
- zine metadata
- a near comprehensive list of zine collections
- volunteers 
- a developer for the front and backends of the catalog, run on Collective Access (https://www.collectiveaccess.org/)
- outreach support

### How can you get involved?
- provide feedback
- donate time
- donate expertise
- make a suggestion
- make a connection
- make a zine
