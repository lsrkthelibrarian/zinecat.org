### What are we doing? (And why?)
There is no one central catalog (a database of library holdings) for searching and finding zines.  In the US, Worldcat.org provides access to a union catalog, but it is mostly for books, journals, and audio visual materials. Zine and zine collections are not consistently cataloged in WorldCat.	

The Zine Union Catalog (ZUC) fills a gap by providing a searchable platform to discover zines and zine collections.

### Who are we?
We are a group of librarians, zinesters, archivists, zine collectors, zine enthusiasts, and more.  :smile_cat: **All are welcome.** :smile_cat: 

For the last two years, Jenna Freedman & Lauren Kehoe have been working on the development of ZineCat through work in their MA in Digital Humanities program at the CUNY Graduate Center.

### What do we need?
- zine metadata
- a near comprehensive list of zine collections

- a developer for the front and backends of the catalog, run on Collective Access (https://www.collectiveaccess.org/)
- outreach support
